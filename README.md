# InterfacePileFace
As part of my training at the efrei school, I put the logic of the interfaces in the existing project heads or tails. The challenge of the project is to practice using interfaces.
Introduce the following interfaces :
- IJoueur 
- estGagnant 
- IJeu 
- void demarrerJeu 
- IPiece 
- boolean aFacePourCoteVisible 
- boolean aPilePourCoteVisible 
- IScore
- int vaut 
- Implement these interfaces from your existing classes, create classes implementing these interfaces, or rename existing methods.
